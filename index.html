            How does the virus spread
          </div>
          <div class="accordion-item-body">
            <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
              The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).

          <div class="accordion-item-body">
            <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
              Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions. This is the point when the spread of the virus becomes difficult to track.

              Community mitigation activities are actions that people and communities can take to slow the spread of infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Community mitigation is especially important before a vaccine or drug becomes widely available.

            <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
              Cleaning does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. If a surface may have gotten the virus on it from a person with or suspected to have COVID-19, the surface should be cleaned and disinfected. Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces.            </div>

              Flattening the curve refers to community isolation measures that keep the daily number of disease cases at a manageable level for medical providers. It is important that people do their best to flatten the curve so that the deaths resulting from COVID-19 remains low          </div>
